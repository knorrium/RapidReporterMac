# Rapid Reporter Mac

Rapid Reporter for Mac is a copy of the testing software originally written by Shmuel Gershon for Windows. The documentation for the original version can be found [here](http://testing.gershon.info/reporter/).

The Mac version requires you to be running OS X 10.10 or above.

## Installation

To install Rapid Reporter Mac simply download the DMG file from the repository's 'RapidReporterMac' folder and use that to install the application.

## Mac Keyboard Shortcuts

The user interface layout is almost identical to that of the Windows original with a few aesthetic alterations due to OSX UI element support. One thing to note is the Rapid Reporter Mac support for Mac keyboard shortcuts, shown below:

| Shortcut | Action |
| :---: | :--- |
&#8984;&#8679; | Take screenshot of active screen |
&#8984;&#8679;S | Open Screenshot Utility   |
&#8984;N | Open New RTF Note |
&#8984;O | Open Working Folder in OSX Finder |
&#8984;[ | Decrease transparency |
&#8984;] | Increase transparency |
&#8984;- | Decrease session length |
&#8984;= | Increase session length |
&uarr; | Next note category |
&darr; | Previous note category |

## Output

The program saves it output into ~/Documents/RapidReporterMacOutput/. In there you can find your reports, RTF notes, and screenshots from each session that are named using timestamps.
